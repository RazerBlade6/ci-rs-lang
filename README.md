# A repo for a project to learn Rust Programming

## Full credit to Robert Nystrom and his fantastic book "Crafting Interpreters"

Please check it out here: (<https://craftinginterpreters.com/>)

This project seeks to re-create the book's Lox Interpreter (originally written in Java and C) in Rust.
This is intended solely to learn Rust, and I make no pretensions to being any good at it.
Please drop a comment if you feel there is somewhere I could be improving (there are definitely any places).

Cheers

P.S. Huge, heartfelt thanks to CodeScope, who has done this project already, and who I took help from when I was well and truly stuck designing While Loops.
